The project consists in developing a console application implementing an address book. 
The inner storage for saving contact data will be a Binary Search Tree. Note: AddressBooks->Hash Table, each book has contacts stored in a BST
The console application must show a terminal prompt like:
address> open book main
address> create book main
address> delete book main
address>exit


There must be a command to select a given address book, as several different address book and may be saved 
(a hash table relating a books name with an AddressBook object).
(In this context, main is the name of the address book)
main> add contact
main> info contact pug
main> delete contact pug
main> search contact pug
main> edit contact pug
main> exit 


Once inside an address book, the user is capable of:
-> Adding a new contact
-> Display the contact info
-> Searching for a contact (Show all contact names that match with the search query)
-> Editing a contact
-> Removing a contact


An address contact must have:
-> A First Name
-> A Last Name
-> A phone number
-> E-mail
-> Relation (Family, friend, etc)
-> Birthday
-> Age (Calculated from birthday)


Each operation should have its unique command attached to its required parameters.
 ANY OTHER COMMAND that the program receives should raise an error (in the form of a unsupported command message)

Finally, the user should be able to exit the program. Upon program termination, all the address books are saved to local storage.
 When the program starts, all data is loaded from local storage.
